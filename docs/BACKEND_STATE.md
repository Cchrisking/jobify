# Back-end state, as seen by the front end

**Written by the back-end session. The front-end session reads it and never edits it.** The front-end session's own notes and requests live in `docs/FRONTEND_STATE.md` (see the hand-off protocol in section 5 there).

Base URL `http://localhost:9080`. Full route reference: `api-documentation.md`, or the OpenAPI JSON at `/v3/api-docs`.

## How to use this file (front-end session)
1. Read "Open requests for the front end" and the newest change-log entries before you start any work.
2. Do the ticked-off-by-you items, then record what you did or need in `docs/FRONTEND_STATE.md`.
3. Entries are newest first. Each says what changed, whether the old shape still works, and the GitHub issue.

## Open requests for the front end
- [ ] Switch `useEmployerJobs` to `GET /jobs/mine`, and handle 403 on job writes (issue #3, #4).
- [ ] Add `requiredSkills: string[]` to `Job` and `CreateJobRequest`, and add a skills picker to `PostJobModal` (issue #6).
- [ ] Extend `SeekerResponse` with `educations/certifications/experiences/skills`, then build the profile-editing UI.
- [ ] Replace `applyForJob` / `saveJob` in-memory state with API calls once the P1 and P2 endpoints ship (issues #9, #10).
- [ ] Replace the fake `matchScore` in `jobEnrichment.ts` once the matching endpoint ships (issue #12).
- [ ] Replace `MOCK_USERS` with `GET /admin/users` (issue #16).

### Sprint 1 — 2026-09-30 (branch `claude/keen-bell-ep73oh`)
Breaking for the front end: none. The 7 fields `PostJobModal` sends still work.

- **B1 (#2)** `PATCH` passes CORS, so the employer open/close toggle now works from the browser.
- **B2 (#3)** New `GET /jobs/mine` (EMPLOYER only, includes closed jobs). **Please switch `useEmployerJobs` to it.** `GET /jobs` still returns every employer's jobs.
- **B3 (#4)** Job writes are checked on the server. A non-employer `POST /jobs` is now **403** `Only employers can post jobs.` (was 404 "Employer not found"). Editing or toggling someone else's job is **403** `You can only change job postings that you created.`
- **B4 (#5)** `jobDescription` is sanitized on write to `p, br, ul, ol, li, strong, em, h2, h3, a[href]`. Max is 20,000 characters of submitted HTML. What comes back may differ slightly from what you sent (emoji as `&#x1f680;`, `rel="nofollow"` on links).
- **B5 (#6)** `POST /jobs` binds `CreateJobRequest`. `requiredSkills` is now an array of **names** (`["Java"]`), not objects. Validation errors are **400** with a message such as `jobTitle is required; jobRating must be between 0 and 5`. New `PUT /jobs/{id}` edits a post (same body, owner only).
- **B7 (#7)** No API change. The JWT secret now comes from `JWT_SECRET`; token format and lifetime are unchanged.
- Any malformed JSON body now returns **400** `The request body is missing or malformed.` instead of 500. Bean-validation failures on other endpoints also return 400 with field names.
- **Behaviour to know:** when an admin approves an employer's account deletion, all of that employer's job posts are deleted with it.
